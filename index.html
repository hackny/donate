        <h3>About the Program</h3>
        <div>
        <p>The hackNY Fellows Program, now entering its seventh year, is an intensive program designed to introduce students to NYC's startup ecosystem by pairing the best technical minds with great New York startups. You'll live in the heart of NYC with a cohort of some of the most talented and creative student technologists from all over the world. Local startups are carefully selected for the program and demonstrate both innovative tech and a strong mentoring environment. You will contribute meaningfully at your paid internship and learn from your work, our curated Speaker Series, and your fellow hackers.</p> 

        <p>The hackNY Fellows Program was listed as one of the <a href="https://www.profellow.com/announcements/top-10-summer-fellowships-of-2015/">Top 10 Summer Fellowships</a> by ProFellow, and has been featured by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2012/01/05/n_computer_science_jobs.cnnmoney/">CNN</a>, the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703302604575294740285039332">Wall Street Journal</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/2011/03/mayor-bloomberg-smiles-upon-hackny/">New York Observer.</a></p>

          <h2>Inspiring Environment</h2>
          <p>We love New York's tech scene for its community spirit and interdisciplinary nature. With so much to be inspired by, from NYC's architecture to its media, fashion, and creative industries, you'll quickly realize why we think Silicon Alley > Silicon Valley.</p>
          <p>All Fellows live together in provided housing in the heart of NYC, within walking distance of great food, parks, and many of our host startups. You'll spend many evenings exploring the city with your friends, and our AlumNY are always happy to offer their experience and recommendations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-6 medium-6 columns">
          <h2>Inspiring Speakers</h2>
          <p>Twice a week, Fellows gather at a local startup's offices for dinner and an informal talk by a New York tech luminary. Speakers include top CEOs, founders, technologists, tech experts in public service, VCs, and legal and media experts. Each talk is followed by plenty of time for questions and discussion.</p>
          <p>For a list of our Class of 2015 speakers and events, see our <a href="hackny.org/a/2015/08/looking-back-on-the-class-of-2015-fellowship/">blog post</a> looking back on last summer.</p>

        <h3>Our community doesn't end when the summer does.</h3>
        <div><p>For most Fellows, the best part of hackNY isn't their startup, the city or even Speaker Series conversations with local tech leaders - it's the AlumNY community you'll be part of throughout your career. With frequent meetups, job postings, and chatting on Slack and IRC, your Fellows classmates and the rest of our AlumNY will always be your best friends and supporters. </p>  
        <p>Recent AlumNY activities have included our traditional pre-hackathon meetup, Women of HackNY dinners, Demo Night, and mixers with the current Fellows. AlumNY are also invited to many of our Speaker Series talks. You might be one of the incoming Fellows we'll be welcoming at our spring hackathon dinner.</p>
